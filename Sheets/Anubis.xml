  <information>Anubis is widely known as the Egyptian deity of mummification. In this role, he oversees the mummification process of the dead, and is usually seen in hieroglyphic tomb-carvings as overseeing the burial ritual for the pharaohs and those of royal lineage - this is due to the priest involved wearing the masks of Anubis to symbolize him as the overseer of the ritual.</information>
