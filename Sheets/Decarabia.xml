  <information>According to the writings in The Lesser Key of Solomon, Decarabia (or Carabia) is the sixty-ninth spirit listed in the Goetia. Although he has no title in the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, in the Lesser Key of Solomon he is a Great Marquis of Hell and has thirty legions of demons under his command. When summoned, Decarabia appears as a pentagram star, although he will take the form of a man if the conjurer requests it. He knows the properties and values of all herbs and precious stones, and can transform into any type of bird to sing and fly for his conjurer, sometimes acting as his animal familiar.</information>
