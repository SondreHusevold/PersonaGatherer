  <information>According to Greek mythology, Lamia was a Libyan queen who fell in love with Zeus, and bore him children. Hera became enraged, and murdered all of Lamia's children (one version of the tale claims that Hera forced Lamia to kill and eat her own children). Lamia went insane with grief, and began kidnapping and eating children, eventually turning into a hideous monster as a result. Legend states how Zeus granted Lamia the ability to remove her own eyes at will, as, otherwise, whenever Lamia closed her eyes, she would see her own dead children.</information>
