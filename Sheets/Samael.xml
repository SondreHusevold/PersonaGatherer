  <information>Samael is an archangel in Talmudic lore. He has been known as the seducer, destroyer, accuser and has been regarded as both good and evil in various texts. In rabbinic lore he was revealed as the chief of Satan's armies and as the Angel of Death. His name means "poison of God", suggesting he is either the vengeful hand of God or the enemy of God, and it has even been suggested that SamaelÂ is the angelic name of Satan himself.</information>
