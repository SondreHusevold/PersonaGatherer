  <information>This beautiful goddess of love is the second consort of Shiva in the Hindu mythology. A mountain princess, she is the reincarnation of the goddess Sati (Shiva's first consort), and won Shiva's love in her previous life despite his asceticism, but self-immolated herself after her father's disapproval. Reborn as Parvati, she sought him out and became his consort once again. They have the ability to merge into the half-male, half-female Ardha.ï»¿</information>
