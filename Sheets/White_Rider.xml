  <information>The White Rider is one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, according to Christian scripture. It traditionally represents conquest, with the "pestilence" association first appearing in the 20th century. Other interpretations include the rider of the white horse as Christ, whose conquest represents the spread of Christianity, or the Anti-Christ, who rides across the world to deceive those who are pious and faithful.</information>
