  <information>Sraosha is known as the "ear" of Ahura Mazda (Ohrmazd), and one of the oldest and most ethical of the Yazatas (Beings Worthy of Worship), being the greatest one of them in Zoroastrianism. As Ohrmazd' "ear", he was the means of the worshipers being able to communicate with Ohrmazd. Because of this, Sraosha is the most important of the Yazatas, typifing the highest virtue of humanity, obedience to and submission to Divine Law. During night and day, Sraosha guards all of the creatures of Ohrmazd from evil demons, being the guardian of Humanity as one of his duties/titles. Rashnu and Mithra are Avestas that are closely associated with Sraosha through judging the souls of the dead.</information>
