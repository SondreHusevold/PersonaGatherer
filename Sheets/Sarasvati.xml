  <information>Hindus believe that Sarasvati is the goddess of knowledge, music and the arts. Sarasvati has been identified with the Vedic Sarasvati River. She is considered as consort of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. Thus, with the goddesses Lakshmi and Parvati or Durga, she forms the Tridevi, who are consorts of the male trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, respectively. Sarasvati's children are the Vedas, which are the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. She is known in East Asia as Benzaiten or Biancaitian (弁財天, lit. "god of wisdom and wealth"), one of the Seven Lucky Gods.</information>
