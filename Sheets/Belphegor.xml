  <information>Belphegor is a demon of Sloth, one of the 7 Deadly Sins. His name is a corruption of Baal-Peor, the name for the god of the Moabites. Belphegor gives people ideas for inventions that will make them rich and thus greedy and selfish. Sometimes is portrayed as a beautiful woman, but other times is portrayed as a monstrous, horned demon.
Some claim that he must be worshiped on a toilet, thus we get his design in the Shin Megami Tensei games.</information>
