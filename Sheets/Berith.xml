  <information>According to the writings in The Lesser Key of Solomon, Berith is the twenty-eighth spirit listed in the Goetia. He rides a gigantic red horse and burns those without manners. He is the duke of Hell. He is a Great Duke of Hell with twenty-six legions of demons under his command. He is depicted as a knight or soldier wearing red armour and a golden crown. In order to speak with him the conjurer must wear a silver ring and hold it before his face. He gives true answers to all things past, present and future as long as he is asked, but when not answering questions is a liar. He can turn any metal into gold, give dignities and confirm them.</information>
