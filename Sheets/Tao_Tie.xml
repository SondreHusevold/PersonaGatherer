  <information>The Taotie, also known by its Japanese name Toutetsu, is said to be a Chinese monster of unknown origin. It is said that it is a greedy monster with an insatiable appetite, and as punishment, only its head remains. Fear of the monster led its image to be cast on Chinese bronzes and ritual vessels. Along with Taown, Hun Dun and Qiong Qi, it is one of the Four Fiends, prominent Chinese demons representing evil virtues. Tao Tie represents gluttony.</information>
