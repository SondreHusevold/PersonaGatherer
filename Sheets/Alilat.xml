  <information>Al-Lat was one of three main idols alongside al-'Uzza and al-Manat worshipped by the people of Mecca before the message of Islam was spread by Prophet Muhammad. Its origins are traced from the traditions of Sumerian civilization brought to pre-Islamic Arabia by merchants and nomads who idolized stones in their daily life. In one instance, it is regarded as a goddess, and had a son Dusura, who was idolized by the people of Petra in ancient Jordan. Alilat is associated with the morning star, which is also associated with Venus. In other words, Al-Lat is Lucifer, but they are separate entities.</information>
