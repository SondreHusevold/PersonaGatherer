  <information>The 64th spirit of the Goetia. He is a great duke and appears at first as a mighty terrible and strong leopard but at the command of his summoner he assumes the shape of a man with fiery eyes and a terrible countenance. He can see the past and future, but unless he is commanded into a triangle he will lie in all those things. He will gladly talk of divinity and of the creation of the world, and of his and other spirits' falls from grace. He can control fire and burn all of his and his summoner's adversaries to death and will not suffer them to be tempted by any spirit or otherwise. He governs 36 legions of spirits.</information>
