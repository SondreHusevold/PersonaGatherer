  <information>According to the book "The Monster That is History" by David Der-wei Wang, the Taowu is a monster of Ancient China that, while skillful in divination and able to see the past and the future, is fierce and violent. The Taowu is said to appear with "a human face, a tiger's feet, a pig's feet and a tail 18 feet long". It is said to be thoroughly stubborn that it would refuse to back down from a fight. Known as one of the Si-xiong (4 Calamities) in ancient Chinese lore along with Tao Tie, Hun Dun and Qiong Qi; it represents ignorance, misguiding man through its divination, throwing him off course of enlightenment while appeasing materialistic, unvirtuous and shallow desires.</information>
