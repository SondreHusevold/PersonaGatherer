  <information>The struggle between the forces of good and evil is represented in tales from the Indonesian island of Bali. Barong represents the forces of good - it is the protector of mankind, using its charms and magic to defend villagers against the deathly black magics of the witch Rangda. He is a guardian spirit that is most commonly seen in the form of a lion, although each region within Bali has its own version of Barong, the others being a dragon, boar, or a tiger. Barong is animated by the brother spirit Banas Pati Rajah to do battle with Rangda in order to restore the balance between good and evil. However after Rangda is killed, she is eventually resurrected, and Barong must do battle once again. This eternal battle is depicted in rituals seen in Bali, and in recent times have become an attraction for tourists.</information>
