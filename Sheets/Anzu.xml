  <information>Anzu, mainly known as Zu, was a demonic tempest bird in Mesopotamian mythology, known for stealing the Tablets of Fate from Enlil, the lord of the Wind. These specific tablets gave the power to whomever possessed them to control the universe. The supreme god Anu promised sovereignty over the gods to whoever recovered the tablets from Anzu. Due to the surviving texts being in fragments, it's unclear to establish the outcome, but it seems that either the god Marduk or Ninurta, Enlil's son, recovered the Tablets.</information>
