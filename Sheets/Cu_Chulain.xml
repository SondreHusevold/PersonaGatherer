  <information>Cu Chulainn is an Irish mythical hero who appears in the stories of the Ulster Cycle, as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. The son of the god Lugh and Deichtine (sister of the king of Ulster), he was originally named Setanta, but gained his better-known name as a child after he killed Culann's fierce guard-dog in self-defense, and offered to take its place until a replacement could be reared. At the age of seventeen he defended Ulster single handedly against the armies of queen Medb of Connacht in the epic Tain Bo Cuailnge. It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but that his life would be short â€“ one reason he is compared to the Greek hero Achilles. He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, in which he becomes an unrecognizable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Laeg, and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend.
Many say he acquired a lot of power by submitting himself to some geis, two of which are "I'll never eat dog meat" and "I'll never refuse a meal offered by a woman". But then a woman offered him some dog meat, as so he had to choose what geis to break and he accepted the meal. After that, he was forced by Queen Madb to break his geis one by one, as so he met his death at the hands of Lugaid (child of Cu Roi, a man he had to kill to defend Ulster).</information>
