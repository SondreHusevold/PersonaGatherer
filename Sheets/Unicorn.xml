  <information>A unicorn is a mythological creature. Though the modern popular image of the unicorn is sometimes that of a horse differing only in the horn on its forehead, the traditional unicorn also has a billy-goat beard, a lion's tail, and cloven hoovesâ€”these distinguish it from a horse. The alicorn, the unicorn's horn, was very valuable during the Middle Ages, which could be used to make very durable materials. This was believed to be the horn of the narwhal, as it has very similar horns to the unicorn.</information>
