  <information>Abaddon is a biblical term in Hebrew which means "place of destruction" and is a fiery plain in the realm of the dead, Gehenna. In the later teachings of Revelation, Abaddon had become a being that personified the abyss, becoming known as the "Angel of the Abyss." He is often depicted as a large, human-sized locust and leads a swarm of locusts and other insects that carry infectious diseases. In this respect, he is often associated with the swarms of locusts that sometimes destroy entire crop fields and in the The Greater Key of Solomon was said to be called upon by Moses to cause the great rains during the Ten Plagues of Egypt.</information>
