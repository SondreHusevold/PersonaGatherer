  <information>The Vermilion Bird is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations (Si Xiang) along with White Tiger, Xuanwu and Azure Dragon. According to Wu Xing, the Taoist five-elemental system, it represents the fire-element, the direction south, and the season summer correspondingly. Thus it is sometimes called the Vermilion Bird of the South and it is also known as Suzaku in Japan and Jujak in Korea. Occasionally confused with Feng Huang. Suzaku is an elegant and noble bird in both appearance and behavior, it is very selective in what it eats and where it perches, with its feathers in many different hues of Vermilion.</information>
