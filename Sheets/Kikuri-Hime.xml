  <information>In Japanese mythology, Kikuri-Hime (or Shirayama-Hime) is the dragon goddess worshiped at Mt. Hakusan and is considered the Shinto goddess of negotiation and mediation. She is also said to bring the rains to the farmlands. In Japanese "Kiku" means "chrysanthemum", which is her symbolic flower and interactively associates with lamentation at death.</information>
