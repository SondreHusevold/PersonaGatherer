  <information>In Japanese mythology, the Nozuchi or Nodzuchi is a spirit of the earth that is found in open plains hiding in the shadows of the plants and trees. While it is not an evil or mischievous spirit, it is wild and uncontrollable, thus it will sometimes bring harm to humans it sees as intruders or threats. Its name means "God of the plains". It is also another name for the serpent monster Tsuchinoko, which is now seen more as a cryptid that takes the form of a fat snake.</information>
